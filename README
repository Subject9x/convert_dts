Utility to convert Earthsiege 2 DTS files to a 3DS mesh
-------------------------------------------------------
[see http://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/q/11495 ]

You need to have lib3ds installed to use this.


Run: python lib3ds_build.py

to generate the python bindings for it.


Run: python convert_dts.py file1.dts file2.dts ...

and hopefully you'll get some 3DS meshes extracted into the current working directory
